# TODOS
- [x] check how to save time/capture messages from the solver when result is
    - [x] UNKNOWN
    - [x] UNSAT
- [ ] URGENT: there's an error with search_strategy flags and solver choice both from command line and code itself
- [ ] connect run_cp to main method, pay attention to manage well all the optional arguments
- [ ] create table from a limited number of instances
- [ ] correct table.py so that it understands from the json whether the instance was UNSAT or UNKNOWN and outputs the correct keywords in the table:

- [ ] OPTIONAL connect table to main (if you think it's useful), or make it runnable with arguments from the command line
