# Build and Run Instructions

This project can be executed either **from the top-level `main.py`** 
(recommended) or by running **individual solvers** directly.

## 1️⃣ Running All Solvers via `main.py`

The `main.py` script provides a unified interface for running one or multiple
solvers and optionally checking their solutions.

**Command Example (Windows):**

Running all solvers with validity check:
```bash
cd CDMO-project-\source
python main.py --mode CP SMT MIP SAT --range 1 45 --check
```
Running just one solver without validity check:
```bash
cd CDMO-project-\source
python main.py --mode CP --range 1 45 --check
```

**Explanation of arguments:**

<!-- check that CP is called as a solver -->

* `--mode`: Specify one or more solvers to run. Choices: `CP`, `MIP`, `SAT`, `SMT`.
* `--range`: Provide the instance range as two numbers (`LOWER UPPER`).
* `--check`: Optional flag to validate solutions after solving.

This command will run **all selected solvers** on the specified range and check 
the results automatically.

## 2️⃣ Running Individual Solvers

Each solver can also be run independently from its folder. This is useful for 
testing or debugging a single solver.

**Command Example (Windows, CP solver):**

```bash
cd CDMO-project-\source\CP
python run_cp.py --range 1 45
```

**Arguments:**

* `--range`: Instance range to solve (`LOWER UPPER`).

> Note: Individual solvers will not automatically check their solutions unless 
    explicitly invoked with `solution_checker.py`.

---

## 3️⃣ Solution Checking

To check the validity of solver outputs separately:

```bash
python solution_checker.py <path_to_solution_directory>
```

* `<path_to_solution_directory>`: Directory containing `.json` solution files 
    generated by the solvers.
